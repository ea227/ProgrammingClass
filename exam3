#Part 1: Adagenet 
library (adegenet)
library(ape)
library(tidyverse)
library(chron)
library(betareg)
#1. Describe the package Adegenet 
##paste in from word doc at end

#2. Use 3 functions from Adegenet 
#get seqs
seqs <- c("OR480414.1", "OR480413.1", "OR480412.1", "OR480114.1",
                     "OR480112.1", "OR480110.1", "OR480134.1")
sardines <- read.GenBank(seqs)

#first function: find mutations: 
findMutations(sardines)

Sardines <- DNAbin2genind(sardines)
class(Sardines)
#second function:
#compute minor allele frequency: 
minorAllele(Sardines)


#third functions:
#create matrix of spp names 
pops <- attr(sardines, "species")

#just a cool one
showmekittens(x = NULL, list = FALSE)

#3 Create a working custom function, loop or conditional that contains at least one function from the package 

data("nancycats")
nancycats
alleles <- nancycats$loc.n.all
names <- nancycats$all.names
for (x in seq(alleles)){
  if (alleles[x] > 10) {
    cat("locus", names(alleles)[x], "greater than 10 alleles\n")
    print(names[[x]])
  }
}

#Part 2: Dryad Database 
#Oto, Yumeki; Kuroki, Mari; Iida, Midori et al. (2023).  A key evolutionary step
#determining osmoregulatory ability for freshwater colonisation in early life 
#stages of fish [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tb2rbp03x

#4. Using the dataset chosen, formulate a hypothesis/question
#Aquaporin3 (aqp3) will show different levels of expression in saltwater and 
  #freshwater popualtions 

#5. Test the hypothesis using an appropriate statistical analysis 
library(readxl)
expression <- read_excel("Data_for_detailed_expression_analysis.xlsx")
View(expression)
#find test to see if expression levels differ between populations 
res_aov <- aov(aqp3 ~ Population, data = dat)
dat <- expression %>%
  select(Population, aqp3)
View(dat)
res_aov <- aov(aqp3 ~ Population, data = dat)
summary(res_aov)


#6. Create at least one publication quality figure of your results and write a short conclusion section
ggplot(dat) +
  aes(x = Population, y = aqp3, color = Population) +
  geom_jitter() + 
  theme(panel.background= element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

#The populations measured do not show significant difference (p value 0.204), 
#indicating that aquaporin3 is not expressed differently between these saltwater 
#and freshwater populations of fishes.

#Part 3
#7.Write a short 1-2 page literature review on how r is used in your area of research


#Part 4
#Test the following hypotheses using appropriate methods: 

#8. Hypothesis: Survival is best predicted by the interaction between population 
#and larval activity 
survivaldata <- read_csv("growthandactivity.csv")
nrow(survivaldata)
as.tibble(survivaldata)
View(survivaldata) #has 1s
survival <- survivaldata %>%  
  filter(Survival <= 1) 
survival$Survival #no more >1 
#model <- glm(cbind(proportional response) ~ var1 * var2, data = data, family = binomial) 
survival$Lives <- round(survival$Survival * survival$Clutch, 0) 
survival$Dies <- survival$Clutch - survival$Lives
survivalmodle <- glm(cbind(Lives, Dies) ~ Population * Activity,
                     data=survival,
                     family = binomial)
summary(survivalmodle)
survival$Predicted_Survival <- predict(survivalmodle, type = "response")

viewsurvival <- ggplot(survival) +
  aes(survival$Activity, survival$Predicted_Survival, colour = as.factor(survival$Population)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(panel.background= element_blank()) +
  labs(
    x = "Activity",
    y = "Prob Survival",
    title = "Predicted Survival vs Activity", 
    color = "Population"
  )
print(viewsurvival)
#Answer: the beta regression showed that interaction between population and 
#larval activity was not significantly correlated to survival. P values were all
#1. The visualization of the data did not show a defined trend either.  


#9: Hypothesis: The number of observed Adele Penguin arrivals is declining over
#time but is declining the fastest in colony 2.1 GLM
adelies <- read_csv("adelie.csv")
library(lme4) #fit linear mixed-effect model
adelies <- penguins
View(adelies)
adelies$Date <- as.Date(adelies$Date)  # now real Date format 
adelies$Year <- format(adelies$Date, "%Y")  # now has a year column
adelies <- na.omit(adelies)
str(adelies$Colony) 
adeliesmodel <- lmer(Adults ~ Year * (as.numeric(Colony) == 2.1) + (1 | Colony), data = adelies)
summary(adeliesmodel)


time_trned <- ggplot(adelies) +
  aes(x = as.numeric(Year), y = Adults, color = as.factor(Colony)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(name = "Colony") +
  labs(title = "Adelie Penguin Arrivals",
       x = "Year", y = "Adults Counted") +
  theme_bw()
print(time_trned)

time_trend2 <- ggplot(adelies) +
  aes(x = as.numeric(Year), y = Adults) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = Colony == 2.1)) +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Colonies",  # Set legend title
    values = c("black", "red"),
    labels = c("Total", "Colony 2.1")) +
  labs(title = "Decline in penguin arrivals",
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Adults Observed") + 
  theme_bw()
print(time_trend2)
#Answer: There is an overall decline in all penguin colonies, with the final year estimate at -156.441. 
#There was also a greater variability between colonies (std. dev 69.60) than within colonies (st dev 48.85).
#Colony 2.1 began with higher population estimates, but experienced a sharper overall decrease than the 
#total colony numbers, supported by significant |t| values. Graphs visualize these trends. 



#10.  All pairwise comparisons of species have a significantly different DBH

alder <- read_csv("alder.csv")
head(alder) #`DBH(cm)`

#try anova 
# Fit the model using the aov() function this should be god 
#model_aov <- aov(weight ~ exercise * age * height * bmi * gender, data = data)
alder_aov <- aov(`DBH(cm)` ~ Species, data = alder)
summary(alder_aov) #significant 
turkeytest <- TukeyHSD(alder_aov)
print(turkeytest) #rose-alder, willow-alder, rose-poplar, willip-poplar, spruce-rose, and willow-spruce 

#the anova tested for differences between pairs, the tukey test showed what was significant. 
#Not all pairs had significanlty different DBH, but rose-alder, willow-alder, 
#rose-poplar, will0w-poplar, spruce-rose, and willow-spruce had significant p values.
